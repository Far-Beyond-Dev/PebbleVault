# PebbleVault
Welcome to PebbleVault, the database that rocks! 🚀 Imagine a world where pebbles are more than just tiny stones; they are the building blocks of your data dreams. PebbleVault is a memory database with a MySQL twist, all wrapped up in the cozy, mamoery-safe blanket of Rust. It’s like having a pet rock collection, but for grown-ups with serious data needs!

## Why PebbleVault? 🌟
- Speed of a Cheetah: With memory-based storage, your pebbles are accessible at lightning speed. Why waste time when you can rock and roll?
- Safety of a Vault: Thanks to Rust, your data is as safe as pebbles in a vault. No more worrying about memory leaks or data corruption.
- Flexibility of a Gymnast: Easily throw your pebbles to MySQL when you need more permanent storage. It's like tossing a pebble across a lake, but with fewer ripples and more data integrity.
- Simplicity of a Skipping Stone: Simple operations to add, drop, and throw pebbles make managing your data as easy as skipping stones on a serene pond.
